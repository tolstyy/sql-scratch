# sql-scratch
The Capstone project (pdf presentation and code) was the final requirement in order to pass the Codecademy Intensive Course called Learn SQL from Scratch.

My choice was - The First- and Last-Touch Attribution project.
CoolTShirts, an innovative apparel shop, is running a bunch of marketing campaigns. In this capstone, one was helping them to  answer these questions about their campaigns:

1. Get familiar with the company.
How many campaigns and sources does CoolTShirts use and how are they related? Be sure to explain the difference between utm_campaign and utm_source.
What pages are on their website?

2. What is the user journey?
How many first touches is each campaign responsible for?
How many last touches is each campaign responsible for?
How many visitors make a purchase?
How many last touches on the purchase page is each campaign responsible for?
What is the typical user journey?

3. Optimize the campaign budget
CoolTShirts can re-invest in 5 campaigns. Which should they pick and why?

Finally, one was responsible to create a set of slides using presentation software. The presentation contains answers to all of the questions listed above. Each answer includes a text explanation and data to support ones claim. The queries used to find that data were included in a separate .sql file.
